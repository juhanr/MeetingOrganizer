 * object holds an immutable URL with which to communicate. Request is made
 * after calling sendRequest() method. Response to the request can be handled in
 * the overridden handleResponseBody() method. Retrieved cookies can be handled
 * in the overridden handleResponseCookies() method. The body of the request can
 * be constructed using the overridden writeToConnection() method.
